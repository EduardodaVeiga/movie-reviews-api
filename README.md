## Features

1. **Review Submission Endpoint**: Users can submit movie reviews with fields such as TMDB ID, Reviewer's name, and Rating.

2. **Database Setup**: Utilizes PostgreSQL to store movie reviews and information while maintaining a relational structure to connect movies with their reviews.

3. **Integration with TMDB API**: Fetches movie data (title, release date, poster, overview) from TMDB API and saves it in the local database to prevent redundant API calls.

4. **Review Retrieval Endpoints**: Offers endpoints to retrieve all reviews of a particular movie and all reviews submitted by a specific user.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)

npm install
```

3. Set up your .env file with the following variables: 
```
NODE_ENV 
DATABASE_NAME 
DATABASE_USERNAME 
DATABASE_PASSWORD 
DATABASE_HOST 
DATABASE_DIALECT

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3009`.

## API Endpoints

1. **Review Submission Endpoint**:
